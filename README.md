# ProU — Frontend (Track 1)

This repository contains the frontend for the ProU demo app for Employee management. Built for Track 1, this Webapp focuses on a functional, responsive Frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript using Local mock JSON data (**Track 2**) and is also compatible with Backend Server (**Track 3**)

## Goal 

### Track 1: Frontend
Build a functional, responsive frontend using mock JSON data. Emphasis on UI/UX, interactivity, and clean code.

This project already includes a lightweight dashboard UI, mock data, and example pages to explore and extend.

### Track 3: Frontend-Backend Integration
The webapp also supports Backend Integration for real data integration using RESTful APIs to manage Employees and Tasks (Details Update, Attandance Managment etc).

## What you'll find here
- Technology: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (generated by create-next-app).
- Mock data: `app/MockData.ts` (TypeScript array + enums) — used as the local JSON data source for the UI.
- Dashboard layout and auth flow: `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — demonstrates token handling via URL/localStorage and a responsive sidebar.

- Pages: `app/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/stats/page.tsx` — example routes showing how the UI consumes the mock data.

## Important Files

- `app/MockData.ts` — mock employee data and types (EmpData, EmpStatus). Use or replace this to prototype UIs without a backend.
- `app/layout.tsx` — global app layout and root UI elements.
- `app/globals.css` — global styles and Tailwind utilities.

- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — client-side dashboard layout with sidebar, active nav, and sign-out logic (reads `?token=` and `localStorage`).
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` and `app/dashboard/stats/page.tsx` — example dashboard pages wired to the layout.

## Running On Local System

### Prerequisites: 
- Node.js
- npm

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the app in your browser

 - http://localhost:3000 — landing page
 - http://localhost:3000/dashboard — dashboard (client layout checks localStorage or `?token=` for auth token)

Notes:
- The dashboard's client layout (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`) expects an auth token either present in the URL as `?token=...` or stored in `localStorage` under the key `authToken`. If a token exists but no stored user data is found, it attempts to call the backend endpoint `https://prou-backend-uywy.onrender.com/auth/whoami` to fetch user info.
## Mock data contract

The mock data shape is defined in `app/MockData.ts` as the `EmpData` type:

- id: number
- name: string
- role: string
- department: string
- status: `EmpStatus` ("Present" | "On Leave")
- salary: number

Use this module as a drop-in data source for components. It's already exported (`MockData`) and typed for convenience.

## UI / UX notes

- Responsive layout: the dashboard uses a fixed-width sidebar and a flexible main area. Styles use utility classes for quick iteration.
- Interactivity: the dashboard layout demonstrates token handling, sign-out, and active-nav highlighting.
- Accessibility & polish: pages use semantic HTML and simple visual states. Consider adding keyboard focus states and ARIA attributes for production.
